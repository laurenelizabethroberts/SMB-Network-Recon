# Findings & Analysis — SMB / Network Recon Demo

## Summary
- Host (198.51.100.100) is reachable and responded to ICMP with low latency.
- Nmap top-100 SYN scan revealed open RPC/SMB ports: 135, 139, 445.
- SMB supports v2/v3 dialects (DFS, leasing, multi-credit operations).
- Null/anonymous SMB sessions are blocked (NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED / NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE).
- NetBIOS name service (UDP 137) did not reliably respond (open|filtered).

## Risk assessment
- Exposure: SMB/RPC reachable — monitor for suspicious SMB activity and ensure EDR/IDS are configured to inspect SMB traffic.
- Likelihood: moderate (internal/lab host).
- Impact: depends on share permissions and patch level; authenticated enumeration required to determine sensitive shares.

## Remediation recommendations
1. Enforce SMB signing and, if possible, SMB encryption for sensitive hosts.
2. Confirm Windows patch level and apply relevant security updates.
3. Review share permissions and remove unnecessary public shares.
4. Limit network access to RPC/SMB services via firewall/host-based rules if not needed.
